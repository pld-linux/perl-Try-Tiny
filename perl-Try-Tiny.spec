%description
This module provides bare bones try/catch statements that are designed
to minimize common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.

This is unlike TryCatch which provides a nice syntax and avoids adding
another call stack layer, and supports calling return from the try
block to return from the parent subroutine. These extra features come
at a cost of a few dependencies, namely Devel::Declare and
Scope::Upper which are occasionally problematic, and the additional
catch filtering uses Moose type constraints which may not be desirable
either.

The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error
handling for those having a hard time installing TryCatch, but who
still want to write correct eval blocks without 5 lines of boilerplate
each time.

It's designed to work as correctly as possible in light of the various
pathological edge cases (see BACKGROUND) and to be compatible with any
style of error values (simple strings, references, objects, overloaded
objects, etc).
